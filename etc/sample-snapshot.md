# today

Here... is your first entry!

The title must be named after the day, but you can use plain phrases like
"today" or "last week"...

This is your history and it is private. Speak plainly to yourself. If you
lie to you then who will you have left?

Delete any placeholder text your find and write your own. Reality has such a
way with people.

## (Close to) daily life
This section is for your immediate life.

### (Self) Vibe check
Rate your immediate mood.

### Last week tonight!
What were the highlights? Think big-picture and remember recent lessons.

Use what happened last week to steer better this week. Write down what
went well and what didn't.

Who do you want to be by next week?

### Daily thoughts
What happend today? 

There is another tool that I find useful for recording daily thoughts.

    `pip install daily-cli`

This program stores daily thoughts in individual files named after their date.

It may be better suited to daily thoughts than snapshat. If you're like me
then you've been hunting for a simple daily journal solution for a while.
Try this one too.

### Todo
Who and what were you supposed to meet and do today?

### Day-in-the-life of you
How do you generally spend your day?

If you work a day job then you should make sure you follow a budget.
It's an excellent survival tip because if helps you grow wealth, which
will help you love your job. Hard not to love what makes you rich, so
make sure you get rich off things your supposed to love!

Take rest, but enjoy your work; as this affirmation of your value saves
you from the gutter and gives you mobililty.

The Finance section has some more technical words on this matter.

### Garden of Income
How do you earn your keep? Your job or business.

You can only earn money when other people give it to you. Strive to help
others, but leave them if they are cruel.

Your efforts help make them rich too. Use your work day to help the good ones.
One person usually can't change the world, but you can always add value
to those around you. I promise you're strong enough for that.

#### Your kingdom
How's your kingdom coming along? Strategic thinking is helped by thinking
broadly, sire. No need to be exact here; ballpark figures will do.

A paid for home is worth much more than a "market value". It is your port
in the storm, your fortress of solitude; a place you always belong.

### Health
How's your health? Remember your body is just as important as your mind. Don't
talk about yourself too much.

Other helpful tidbits. Don't drink or smoke too much. Avoid processed foods.
You will feel better having not consumed garbage. Old people tend to advise
taking care of your body.

But if you're with friends and it's kind of special, drink a beer or have a
smoke. Your end time will not be affected.

### Goals
Where do you want to be in 3 years? You remember 3 years ago pretty well.
Your life is probably a little different since then. If it isn't, then
you probably wish you made some moves.

If you're worse off, then you should know that people's sympathies end where
your irresponsibility begins. Get out of your own head and people can love you
again, though the consequences must still be borne out.

### Project radar
Hobbies are fun. Learn a skill and re-read this section to remember the
inkling of a commitment.Getting into any new hobby is simple; buy basically
good second hand equipment and meaningfully integrate it in your life.

You will commit to something; even if it's nothing.
